        <td>C</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>This was a silly mistake. I misclicked C but I knew the answer was B. It has to be public to allow other classes to access the value.</td>

        <td>Question 18</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>B</td>

        <td>Question 25</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>Choice I should also be included because in choice I you get height, width, and the depth of the box by using the get methods for each of those. This gives the ability to compare the dimensions to see if the box fits or not.</td>

    <tr>
        <td>Question 31</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>I forgot that the value is being updated so that new value needs to be used in the next iteration of the for loop instead of the old value.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Question 34</td>
        <td>C</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>Choice III cant be the answer because it does not use the parameter Point constructure to center a new Point with x and y. It tries to update x and y but it cant because they are private variables</td>
