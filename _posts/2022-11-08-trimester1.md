# Overall Reflection

Overall, this trimester provided a wealth of learning opportunities. PBL allowed me to utilize technologies and skills that I probably wouldn't have used before. Also, we were able to address most of the 10 CSA units for the College Board and other basic Java/OOP related subjects. One thing I had never used was springboot and java mostly. This trimester allowed me to tinker with it and gain new skills that will help me in trimester 2.

## Java Springboot

Java springboot being a high learning curve I still was able to enjoy the learning process. From PBL and the use of Java springboot I finally understood how many companies use a frontend and backend. The usually request the external API in the backend and get the JSON and then in the frontend they call their own api url to get that data. This allows them to control what data is actually being shown to the user. I really liked this idea and hopefully in trimester two I can add authentication so only my frontend can access this data and not some other external user.

## AWS

AWS is something I have been pretty good at. This trimester I was able to play with docker-compose and docker containers and containerize my java project. This allowed me to understand how java projects get compiled and deployed.
