        <td>Question 58</td>
        <td>C</td>

        <td>Question 64</td>
        <td>D</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>It can only be III because in I it has arr[i] but in an enhanced loop you are already given the value not the index.</td>

        <td>Question 66</td>
        <td>E</td>
        <td>B</td>
        <td>This is a silly mistake. It is obvious that it has to be less than 10 as the for loop was also less than 0 and all the values printed in the given segment are less than 10.</td>

# Overall Reflection

Overall, I think I did pretty well on this quiz. There were a lot of De Morgan's law questions, which took some time as you have to look at each answer choice to find the correct one. I was able to understand most of the conceptual ones. I do need to work on substring and indexOf as I got stuck on some but was still able to find the correct answer. I need to stop overlooking the question and not try to go as fast as possible.
